# HA Daily Counter

**HA Daily Counter** is a custom integration for Home Assistant that provides **daily-resettable counters**, perfect for tracking repetitive actions like door openings, light switches, sensor triggers, and more.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Create one or more counters with custom names.  
- Increment counters when one or more trigger entities reach a specified state.  
- Supports **multiple triggers** with configurable logic:  
  - **AND** ‚Üí Increment only when all triggers are active.  
  - **OR** ‚Üí Increment when any trigger is active.  
  - **NAND** ‚Üí Increment when not all triggers are active.  
  - **NOR** ‚Üí Increment only when none of the triggers are active.  
- Auto-reset counters daily at midnight (**local time**).  
- Persistent counter values across Home Assistant restarts.  
- Fully manageable via the UI (no YAML required).  
- Exposed as devices and `sensor` entities with `state_class: total_increasing` and `mdi:counter` icon for proper history graphs.  
- Two custom services to reset or set counter values manually.

## üì¶ Installation

### Option 1: HACS (recommended)
1. Add this repository as a **custom repository** in HACS.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

1. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services**.  
2. Click **Add Integration** and search for **HA Daily Counter**.  
3. Follow the multi-step form:  
   - **Name** ‚Üí Friendly label for your counter.  
   - **Entity to Monitor** ‚Üí Select the entity that will increment the counter.  
   - **State to Monitor** ‚Üí Choose the state that will trigger an increment.  
   - **Add another trigger?** ‚Üí (Optional) Add additional entities with the same state condition.  
   - **Trigger Logic** ‚Üí Define how multiple triggers should be combined (`AND`, `OR`, `NAND`, `NOR`).

## üîç Example Use Cases

- Count how many times a front door opened today.  
- Track how often a light was switched on or off.  
- Monitor motion detector activations or button presses.  
- Combine with automations to notify when thresholds are reached.  

---

## ‚ö° How It Works

- The counter increases by 1 whenever the configured trigger(s) enter the monitored state.  
- Resets to 0 automatically every day at **00:00 local time**.  
- Retains its value across Home Assistant restarts.  
- Visible as a **sensor entity** linked to a device for easy management.

## üõ†Ô∏è Services

After setup, the following services are available under the `ha_daily_counter` domain:

### 1. `ha_daily_counter.reset_counter`
Reset a counter back to zero.

**Fields:**
- `entity_id` _(required)_: The `entity_id` of the counter to reset.

**Example:**
```yaml
service: ha_daily_counter.reset_counter
target:
  entity_id: sensor.my_counter
```

---

### 2. `ha_daily_counter.set_counter`
Set a counter to a specific integer value.

**Fields:**
- `entity_id` _(required)_: The `entity_id` of the counter to adjust.  
- `value` _(required)_: Integer to assign to the counter.

**Example:**
```yaml
service: ha_daily_counter.set_counter
data:
  entity_id: sensor.my_counter

## üé® Icon Curiosity

Why does the icon show the number **28**?  
Because 28 is a **perfect number** ‚Äî a positive integer equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors.  
For 28: `1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28`.  
Mathematics, beauty, and poetry.
