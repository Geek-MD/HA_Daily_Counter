# HA Daily Counter

**HA Daily Counter** is a custom integration for Home Assistant that provides **daily-resettable counters**, perfect for tracking repetitive actions like door openings, light switches, sensor triggers, and more. Now with **multiple trigger support** and **custom logic operators**.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Create one or more counters with custom names.  
- Configure **one or more trigger entities**.  
- Choose the **state** (`on`, `off`, or custom states) that increments the counter.  
- Define how multiple triggers are combined with **logic operators**:  
  - **AND** ‚Üí All triggers must be active.  
  - **OR** ‚Üí Any trigger increments the counter.  
  - **NAND** ‚Üí Counter increments when *not all* triggers are active.  
  - **NOR** ‚Üí Counter increments only if none of the triggers are active.  
- Assign an **area** to the counter for better organization in Home Assistant.  
- Auto-reset counters daily at midnight (00:00 local time).  
- Persistent values across Home Assistant restarts.  
- Fully manageable via the UI (no YAML required).  
- Exposed as `sensor` entities with `state_class: total_increasing` and `mdi:counter` icon.  
- Includes **reset** and **set** services for manual control.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

1. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services ‚Üí Add Integration ‚Üí HA Daily Counter**.  
2. Fill in the multi-step form:  
   - **Name**: Friendly name of the counter.  
   - **Trigger Entity**: Entity that will increment the counter.  
   - **Trigger State**: State value to monitor (e.g., `on`, `off`).  
   - **Add Another Trigger?**: Toggle to add additional triggers.  

3. If multiple triggers are added:  
   - Select additional entities and states.  
   - At the end, configure the **logic operator** and optionally assign an **area**.  

---

## üí° Example Use Cases

- Count how many times the front door opened today.  
- Track how often lights were turned **on**.  
- Monitor motion detectors across multiple rooms, combined with **OR** logic.  
- Require two conditions (e.g., window open **AND** heater on) to increment.  
- Use **NOR** to count when no devices are active.

## üñ• Services

Available services under the `ha_daily_counter` domain:

### 1. `ha_daily_counter.reset_counter`
Reset a counter to zero.

```yaml
service: ha_daily_counter.reset_counter
target:
  entity_id: sensor.my_counter
```

---

### 2. `ha_daily_counter.set_counter`
Set a counter to a specific integer value.

```yaml
service: ha_daily_counter.set_counter
data:
  entity_id: sensor.my_counter
  value: 42
```

---

## üìä How It Works

- The counter increases by `+1` when its triggers match the configured states.  
- If multiple triggers are configured, the logic operator defines how they combine.  
- Counters reset to **0 every midnight** (local time).  
- Values persist across Home Assistant restarts.
