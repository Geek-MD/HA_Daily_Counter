## [1.3.9] - 2025-12-11

### ✨ New Feature: Counter Reconfiguration via Options Flow

This release adds the ability to edit and reconfigure existing counters directly through the Home Assistant UI, without having to delete and recreate them.

### Added
- ✨ **Edit Counter Option**: New "Edit counter" action in the options flow menu
- 🔄 **Reconfigure Trigger Entity**: Ability to change the entity that triggers the counter
- 🔄 **Reconfigure Trigger State**: Ability to change the state that increments the counter
- 🔄 **Automatic Reload**: Integration automatically reloads when configuration changes are saved
- 📋 **Current Values Display**: Shows current configuration before making changes in the edit flow

### Changed
- Updated `__init__.py` to register an update listener that reloads the integration when options are modified
- Enhanced `options_flow.py` with new edit steps: `async_step_select_edit`, `async_step_edit_trigger_entity`, and `async_step_edit_trigger_state`
- Updated all translation files (en.json, es.json, strings.json) with new edit-related strings
- Updated version to 1.3.9 in manifest.json

### Technical Details
- Added `async_reload_entry` function in `__init__.py` to handle config entry reloads
- Registered update listener in `async_setup_entry` to detect option changes and trigger reload
- Modified `HADailyCounterOptionsFlow` class to track editing state with `_selected_edit_index` and `_editing_counter`
- Edit flow preserves counter ID to maintain entity continuity

### How to Use
1. Go to Settings → Devices & Services
2. Find your HA Daily Counter integration
3. Click "Configure" on any existing counter entry
4. Select "Edit counter" from the action menu
5. Choose which counter you want to edit
6. Update the trigger entity or trigger state
7. The integration will automatically reload with the new configuration

## [1.3.8] - 2025-12-10

### 🔧 Critical Bug Fix Release

This release fixes the persistent migration error that continued to affect users even after v1.3.7.

### Fixed
- ✅ **Root Cause Fixed**: Resolved persistent "Flow handler not found for entry" error by properly registering ConfigFlow with Home Assistant
- ✅ Updated `HADailyCounterConfigFlow` to use modern ConfigFlow registration syntax: `class HADailyCounterConfigFlow(config_entries.ConfigFlow, domain=DOMAIN)`
- ✅ Added `async_migrate_entry` function in `__init__.py` for better config entry migration handling
- ✅ All existing counters now load properly after restart
- ✅ Options menu now accessible for all config entries

### Who should upgrade?
**All users experiencing "Flow handler not found" errors should upgrade to v1.3.8 immediately** to restore full functionality.

### Technical Details
- The root cause was that the ConfigFlow class used old-style domain registration (`domain = DOMAIN` as class attribute) instead of the modern approach (`domain=DOMAIN` as class parameter)
- In Home Assistant 2021.11+, ConfigFlow classes must register by passing domain as a parameter to the parent class
- v1.3.7 added `async_get_options_flow` but didn't fix the underlying registration issue
- This fix ensures proper ConfigFlow registration with Home Assistant's flow handler registry

### Installation
1. Update via HACS or manually install v1.3.8
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Verify all counters load properly and options menu is accessible

## [1.3.7] - 2025-12-10

### 🔧 Critical Bug Fix Release

This release fixes a critical migration error introduced in v1.3.6 that prevented existing counters from working properly.

### Fixed
- ✅ **Critical Migration Error**: Resolved "Flow handler not found for entry" error that caused all existing counters to be disabled after upgrading to v1.3.6
- ✅ Added missing `async_get_options_flow` static method to `HADailyCounterConfigFlow` class to properly link the options flow handler
- ✅ Existing config entries now work correctly and counters are no longer disabled after upgrade

### Who should upgrade?
**All users who upgraded to v1.3.6 should upgrade to v1.3.7 immediately** to restore functionality to their existing counters.

### Technical Details
- The issue occurred because Home Assistant could not find the options flow handler for existing config entries
- The `config_flow.py` had a `HADailyCounterConfigFlow` class but was missing the `async_get_options_flow` static method
- This method is required to connect the config flow to the `HADailyCounterOptionsFlow` class defined in `options_flow.py`
- This fix ensures backward compatibility with existing installations

### Installation
1. Update via HACS or manually install v1.3.7
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Your existing counters should now be enabled and working

## [1.3.6] - Previous Release

### Added
- Multiple trigger support with custom logic operators (AND/OR)
- Domain filtering for entity selection
- Text filtering when adding additional triggers
- Enhanced multi-step configuration flow

### Changed
- Improved entity selection UI with domain-specific filtering
- Enhanced configuration workflow for adding multiple triggers

## Release Notes for v1.3.7

**🔧 Critical Bug Fix Release**

This release fixes a critical migration error introduced in v1.3.6 that prevented existing counters from working properly.

### What was fixed?
